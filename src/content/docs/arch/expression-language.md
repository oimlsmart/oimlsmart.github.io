SMART forms use two complementary expression languages: **AsciiMath** for arithmetic and **OCL** (Object Constraint Language) for boolean conditions.

## AsciiMath (arithmetic)

AsciiMath is a lightweight, plain-text mathematical notation. In SMART, it is used inside Calculation expressions to describe how a derived field is computed from its inputs.

```
E = (I - I_ref) / f
mpe_n = max(|I_n - I_ref_n|) / f
delta_T = T_ambient - T_ref
```

The engine parses AsciiMath into an AST, validates it against the declared input types, and evaluates it numerically at runtime.

## OCL (boolean conditions)

OCL is used wherever a boolean verdict is required — most importantly in form-level `pass_if` expressions and requirement applicability filters.

```txt
context LoadCellErrorForm
inv Pass:
  self.error->forAll(e | e.value <= e.mpe)
  and self.repeatability->forAll(r | r.value <= r.mpeRepeatability)
```

OCL was chosen because:

- It is declarative and side-effect-free.
- It has well-defined semantics over object graphs.
- It is already used in UML/SysML ecosystems familiar to standards authors.
- It is the constraint language of choice in MMEL and Primmel.
