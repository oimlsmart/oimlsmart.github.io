The Instrument Model is the data hierarchy used to describe what is being certified. It runs from a broad family down to individual physical samples.

```
InstrumentModelFamily
  └─ ClassificationGroup
       └─ InstrumentModel
            └─ InstrumentSample
```

## InstrumentModelFamily

A family represents a coherent product line from a manufacturer — for example, "Mettler Toledo PM load cells". It groups together all the models that share a common technology and intended use.

## ClassificationGroup

Within a family, models are grouped by **classification dimensions** — typically accuracy class, measurement range, or other technical characteristics defined by the Recommendation's `dimensions.yaml`. For R 60, accuracy class (A / B / C) is a primary classification.

## InstrumentModel

A specific model — a unique combination of family, classification, and other technical attributes. The model is what is being type-examined. One model may have multiple samples tested.

## InstrumentSample

A physical instance of a model, identified by serial number. Samples are the units that actually go through testing. The Recommendation specifies how many samples per model are required (typically 1–3).

## Why the hierarchy matters

- **Family-level declarations** avoid redundant data entry — manufacturer, intended use, and construction details are declared once.
- **Classification-driven evaluation** — the dimension context for a sample is computed by walking up to its classification group, which selects the applicable requirement criteria.
- **Multi-sample aggregation** — test reports aggregate evidence across all samples of a model.
